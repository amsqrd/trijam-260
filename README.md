Source code for amsqrd's Trijam 260 entry. The theme is "Underneath Us"

[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-260) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours of development time.

## Synopsis

*What Skitters Beneath* is a simple web game where players are in control of a bug dodging the footsteps of humans above. Players move the bug in a grid with arrows keys or WASD.  As the game time elapses, the game increases in difficulty with the addition of more humans walking around.
